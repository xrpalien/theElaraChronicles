## The Last Signal
The stars stretched endlessly above the desolate expanse of Eridani-7, a rocky planet orbiting a dying red dwarf. Its surface, pocked with craters and laced with veins of frozen methane, gleamed faintly under the star’s feeble glow. Beneath this unforgiving terrain, in a labyrinth of tunnels carved by long-extinct volcanic activity, Dr. Elara Voss crouched beside a humming console, her breath fogging the inside of her helmet. The air in her suit was stale, recycling the same molecules for weeks, but she barely noticed. Her attention was fixed on the signal.

It had come without warning, a sharp, rhythmic pulse buried in the cosmic background noise. The array of dishes on the surface, maintained by her team of three, had caught it two days ago. At first, they thought it was interference—Eridani-7 was a graveyard of dead probes and forgotten satellites, their decaying orbits spitting static into the void. But this was different. The signal carried structure, intent. It was artificial, and it wasn’t human.

“Elara, you’ve been at it for sixteen hours,” came a voice through her comms, crackling with the faint distortion of the underground relay. It was Kael, her geologist, always the worrier. “You need to eat. Sleep. Something.”

“I’m fine,” Elara replied, her voice clipped. She adjusted a dial on the console, filtering out a layer of noise. The signal sharpened, its pattern resolving into a sequence of primes—2, 3, 5, 7, 11—repeating in bursts. Her pulse quickened. “This isn’t random, Kael. It’s deliberate.”

“Deliberate or not, you’re no good to us if you collapse.” His tone softened. “Mira’s running diagnostics on the surface array. Come back to the hab, at least for a bit.”

Elara didn’t respond. She couldn’t tear herself away. The signal was a whisper from the void, a message from something—or someone—beyond the reach of humanity’s fledgling steps into the galaxy. She’d spent her life chasing ghosts like this, ever since she was a child staring at the stars from the roof of her family’s hab on Mars. The universe was too vast to be empty, she’d always believed. Now, here it was: proof.

The tunnels of Eridani-7 had been their home for six months, a research outpost funded by a coalition of Earth universities desperate to justify their budgets. The team’s mission was to study the planet’s geological history, but Elara’s real obsession was the array. She’d convinced the coalition to install it, arguing that Eridani-7’s thin atmosphere and low electromagnetic interference made it a perfect listening post. No one expected to find anything. Not really. The galaxy was silent, or so the prevailing wisdom went. Humanity had screamed into the void for centuries—radio waves, laser pulses, even physical probes—and heard nothing back.

Until now.

The console beeped, pulling her from her thoughts. The signal had shifted, the prime sequence giving way to something new: a complex waveform, dense with data. Elara’s gloved fingers flew over the controls, routing the signal through the outpost’s quantum processor. The machine hummed, its cooling fans struggling in the thin air. Lines of code scrolled across her screen, fragments of a language she couldn’t yet parse. But it was language. She was sure of it.

“Kael, Mira, get down here,” she said into her comms, her voice trembling with excitement. “You need to see this.”



By the time Kael and Mira descended into the tunnel, the signal had stabilized. The three of them huddled around the console, their suits casting long shadows on the jagged walls. Mira, the team’s engineer, squinted at the screen, her dark eyes narrowing behind her visor.

“It’s structured, all right,” she said, her voice steady but laced with unease. “But it’s not just a message. Look at the data density. This is… instructions. A blueprint, maybe.”

“For what?” Kael asked, his broad frame hunched to fit in the cramped space. His hands, usually steady from years of drilling core samples, fidgeted at his sides.

Elara didn’t answer immediately. She was running the data through a decryption algorithm, one she’d written years ago for a SETI project that never got off the ground. The algorithm was crude, built on assumptions about how an alien intelligence might communicate, but it was all she had. The screen flickered, and a schematic began to take shape—a lattice of interconnected nodes, pulsing with energy flows. It looked like a machine, or part of one.

“It’s a device,” Elara said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. “The signal’s telling us how to build it.”

Kael snorted, his breath fogging his visor. “Build it? With what? We’ve got a 3D printer that can barely churn out spare bolts.”

Mira ignored him, leaning closer to the screen. “The materials list is embedded in the signal. It’s… specific. Rare isotopes, quantum-grade superconductors. Stuff we don’t have lying around.”

Elara’s mind raced. The signal’s origin was still untraceable, its source masked by the galaxy’s ambient radiation. But the instructions were clear, almost too clear, as if the sender knew exactly what resources a human outpost might have access to. Eridani-7’s crust was rich in rare elements, remnants of its violent formation. They could, in theory, mine what they needed. The printer could handle the rest, if they pushed it to its limits.

“We can do this,” Elara said, her voice firm now. “We have the tools. We have the data. This is why we’re here.”

Kael crossed his arms. “Hold on. We don’t even know what this thing does. You want to build an alien machine based on a signal we can’t trace? What if it’s a weapon? Or a beacon to summon something we can’t handle?”

Mira nodded slowly. “He’s got a point. We need to be careful. This could be a trap.”

Elara’s jaw tightened. She’d heard the arguments before—caution, skepticism, the endless refrain of “what if.” But this wasn’t a thought experiment. This was real. “If we don’t build it, we’ll never know. This could be first contact. The first proof we’re not alone. Are you really willing to walk away from that?”

The tunnel fell silent, the only sound the faint hum of the console and the distant drip of water from a melting methane vein. Kael and Mira exchanged a glance, their faces unreadable behind their visors. Finally, Mira spoke.

“I’m in. But we do this by the book. Full diagnostics, no shortcuts. And if anything feels off, we pull the plug.”

Kael sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. “Fine. But I’m not digging up half the planet for this. We use what’s in the storage bay first.”

Elara nodded, her heart pounding. “Deal.”



Over the next three weeks, the outpost became a hive of activity. Kael mapped the tunnels for deposits of the required isotopes, his drills echoing through the caverns. Mira overhauled the 3D printer, coaxing it to handle the exotic materials specified in the signal. Elara translated the schematic, her nights blurring into days as she wrestled with the alien logic embedded in the code. The device, as far as she could tell, was a kind of transmitter, but its purpose remained elusive. It wasn’t broadcasting radio or light—it manipulated something deeper, a quantum field she couldn’t fully understand.

As the components took shape, so did the tension. Kael grew quieter, his skepticism hardening into unease. Mira, usually unflappable, started double-checking every step, as if expecting the machine to turn on them. Elara felt it too—a nagging doubt, like a shadow at the edge of her vision. The signal never stopped, its pulse a constant reminder that something out there was watching, waiting.

On the twenty-second day, the device was complete. It stood in the center of the main cavern, a lattice of shimmering metal and crystal, no larger than a table but radiating a faint, unnatural heat. Elara connected the final power conduit, her hands trembling. The schematic had included an activation sequence, a simple command to initialize the device. She hesitated, her finger hovering over the console.

“This is it,” she said, her voice echoing in the cavern. “Once we turn it on, there’s no going back.”

Kael stood by the entrance, his drill propped against the wall like a weapon. “Last chance to rethink this, Elara.”

Mira checked the power readings one last time. “Everything’s stable. If it’s going to blow up, it’s not because of us.”

Elara took a deep breath and pressed the key.

The device hummed to life, its lattice glowing with a soft, pulsing light. The air in the cavern seemed to thicken, charged with an energy that made Elara’s skin prickle. The console lit up with new data, a stream of information flowing faster than she could process. Then, without warning, the signal stopped.

Silence filled the cavern, heavy and absolute.

“What happened?” Kael asked, stepping forward. “Did it break?”

Elara shook her head, her eyes fixed on the console. The device was still active, its energy signature steady. But the signal—the one that had guided them for weeks—was gone. In its place was something new: a single, clear transmission, not from the stars but from the device itself.

“It’s… talking,” Elara whispered.

The transmission resolved into words, displayed in stark white on the console’s screen: THANK YOU. WE SEE YOU NOW.

Mira gasped, her hand gripping Elara’s arm. Kael swore under his breath, backing toward the tunnel’s exit. Elara stared at the words, her mind racing. The device wasn’t a transmitter. It was a lens, a way to bridge distances not just in space but in perception. Whatever had sent the signal wasn’t just communicating—it was observing, learning, reaching across the void to touch them.

Before she could speak, the device pulsed again, and the cavern filled with light. Images flickered in the air—cities of crystal and light, beings of energy and form, a civilization vast and ancient, watching from a place beyond the stars. Elara’s breath caught in her throat. This was no invasion, no trap. It was an invitation.

The last signal had been a question. They had answered.
